# SAS Base Certification Reference Guide

The purpose of this is to create a free or almost free reference guide to study towards SAS certification. 
I fully believe the SAS Certification Prep Guide is quite good at covering the SAS material, but sometimes you need some more background or more information.

Each topic will be listed as a heading and links to the reference documents will be underneath. 

**_This is a work in progress that will be completed over time. If you have suggestions feel free to drop me a line at stat_geek hotmail.com_**

## Create temporary and permanent SAS data sets.
Still looking for a reference!

## Combine SAS Data Sets
**_This one is a big issue and is such an important part of working iwth data that I'll separate this into a few different sections._**

### Concatenate Data Sets

### Merge Data Sets: one-to-one

#### SQL
https://support.sas.com/resources/papers/proceedings/proceedings/forum2007/109-2007.pdf
_This covers SQL in significant detail and not all items are relevant to joins/unions though it's useful to know._

#### Data Step
_In this case, the best reference I've come across is the documentation. The order isn't great, but it still goes over everything you need to know. I recommend reading this entire chapter._

Tutorial on converting a working program to a macro - this method is pretty robust and helps prevent errors and makes it much easier to debug your code.
